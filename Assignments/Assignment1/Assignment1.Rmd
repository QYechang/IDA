## Using R:  Vectors


Using `c` to combine the values, we see that $x$ is a vector.
```{r 1a}
x<- c(3,12,6,-5,0,8,15,1,-10,7)
is.vector(x)
```
To create the new vector $y$ as a sequence from the min of $x$ to the max of $x$, we do the following:
```{r 1b}
y <-seq(min(x),max(x), length.out = 10)
y
```
I was not familiar with the `length.out` command but found it in the Help package to see that it would restrict the output to that many elements.

We compute the desired stats next

```{r 1c}
#consider changing this one with some tidy code
sum(x)
sum(y)
mean(x)
mean(y)
sd(x)
sd(y)
var(x)
var(y)
mad(x)
mad(y)
quantile(x,1/4)
quantile(y,1/4)
quantile(x,3/4)
quantile(y,3/4)
quantile(x,1/5)
quantile(y,1/5)
quantile(x,3/5)
quantile(y,3/5)
quantile(x,2/5)
quantile(y,2/5)
quantile(x,4/5)
quantile(y,4/5)
```
To do sampling with replacement we do the following

```{r 1d}
sample(x,7,TRUE)
```
The `TRUE` gives the replacement.  Some instances do see repeated vales.

Next we do the `t.test`
```{r}
t.test(x,y)
```
We fail to reject the null hypothesis here.  There is no evidence to suggest that the mean values are different.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
